# EC601Project3
Here is EC601 project 3, which contains the pylint test and unit test of project2. 

Unfortunately, my sentiment analysis code was written in jupyter notebook, but I did not figure out how to run unit test in jupyter notebook, so I had to simplyfy the original code so that it can be run locally, and then used unit test for testing.

Also, I used the pylint function package mentioned in the slide to score the code, and constantly modify the naming style (such as snake naming, camel case naming), modify indentation, and delete redundant conditional judgment statements.
