# EC601project2NLP
This is EC601 project2: Google NLP
In this project, I chose a google NLP model and input the csv data into the model
The uploading and training took a very long time, about several hours
After training, we can input any word or sentence into test window, and this would tell us the emotion feature of the word
The emotion feature includes: 

①enjoy 

②achievement 

③leisure 

④affection 

⑤exercise 

⑥nature 

⑦bonding

I uploaded the generated Python file and a PDF which includes parts of the test
