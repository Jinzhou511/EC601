# EC601_Project2_TwitterBot
This is a TwitterBot, it can automatically find the tweet which @ it and with specif content: "#zjz", then reply it with: zjz.
But TWITTER always shut it down or restrict it, I have no idea.
You need to input your own API key, API key secret, ACCESS key, ACCESS key secret.
I learnt it from Youtube Uploader: Certified Recaps.
There are still some small function mistakes, I might fixed it later.
