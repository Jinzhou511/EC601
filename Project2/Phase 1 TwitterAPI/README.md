# EC601_Project2_TwitterAPI
In this part, there are 3 demos: TweetPosting Bot, TweetReplying Bot, and Get N tweets func.
## 1.TweetPosting Bot
`TweetPostBot.py`
## 2.TweetReplying Bot
`TwitterReplyBot.py`

This is a Twitter Auto Replying Bot, it can automatically find the tweet which @ it and with specif content: "#zjz"(or something else, you can change this), then reply it with: zjz.

But TWITTER always shut it down or restrict it, I have no idea.

You need to input your own API key, API key secret, ACCESS key, ACCESS key secret.

I learnt it from Youtube Uploader: Certified Recaps.

There are still some small function mistakes, I might fixed it later.

## 3.Get N tweets func
`get_n_tweets.py`
