# Project2 
In this dict, there are three parts:TwitterAPI, GoogleNLP, and Sentiment Analysis.
## Phase 1
### · Twitter API

I wrote 3 demo for twitter API. 

The first one is `TweetPostBot.py`, which can randomly choose a sentence from the <The Truman Show>'s lines 'Good morning, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!' and post it.
  
The second one is `TwitterReplyBot.py`, it can automatically find the tweet which @ the Bot with specif content: "#zjz" (or something else, you can change this), then reply it with: zjz.
  
The third one is `get_n_tweets.py`, this func can automatically get n tweets(the number is set in the program) from one specific user(also set in program),such as get 100 tweets from Bill Gates, get 50 tweets from Elon Mask. This is for the preparation of next phase, the tweets this func get can be used for sentiment analysis.
